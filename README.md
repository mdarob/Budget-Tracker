# Budget-Tracker

This program uses the BudgetExpense Class to save budget/expense to the Database. The user must enter year and month for budget but 
no need to enter for expense. This program asks to enter year, month, rent, insurance, ... etc. Then, it will save data to Database and print 
a result for the user by each variable. For example, if the rent expense is higher than the rent budget then it will print a message with the 
overspending amount.  

Future Ideas one might implement:

1. Create a GUI
2. Create data visualization
